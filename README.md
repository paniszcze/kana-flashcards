- centralise application state (Redux / React hooks)
- display answer counts in Results modal outside of colored bar if they don't fit in
- hide language toggle when clicking outside dropdown div
- move constants into separate file
- make svg counter scalable (refactor into function taking width as parameter)
- add Polish language support
- add keyboard navigation
