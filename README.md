Learn Japanese kana with customisable flashcard deck.

## About

Single Page Application built with React.

**_Please, bear in mind that this is an ongoing project. The application is not yet fully developped and any functionality may be subject to change._**

### TODO

- make the first flashcard to be randomly generated instead of showing the welcome message ("let's â€“ begin")
- trigger results modal on reaching the flashcards limit
- display the count numbers in results modal outside of the count bar if they don't fit in
- enable quiting modals and dropdowns when clicking on the background
- refactor calculation of circular counter bars (abstract away into a function)
- centralise application state with Redux
- expand settings options and hook it with application's state (requires dictionary update as well)
- add Polish language support and enable language toggle in the navbar
- make the page responsive
- make the page more accessible (keyboard navigation, etc.)
- create a queue of flashcards on each run and track the answers to show the least known kana in the results
