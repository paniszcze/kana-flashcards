## About

Single Page Application built with React.

**_Please, bear in mind that this is an ongoing project. The application is not yet fully developped and any functionality may be subject to change._**

### TODO

- make the first flashcard to be randomly generated instead of showing the welcome message ("let's â€“ begin")
- trigger results modal on reaching the flashcards limit
- display the count numbers in results modal outside of the count bar if they don't fit in
- enable quiting modals and dropdowns when clicking on the background
- fix language toggle button (background styling and set showLanguage to false when accessing Results modal)
- centralise application state with Redux
- hook settings options with application's state (requires dictionary update)
- move constants into separate file (countbar's circumference, etc.)
- add Polish language support
- add keyboard navigation
- create a queue of flashcards on each run and track the answers to show the least known kana in the results
